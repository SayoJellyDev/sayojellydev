# Hiiiii!
## I'm Sayo or Jelly! :o
Either one is fine!

I'm just some web developer that wants to make games and then proceeds to procrastinate!

I like:
- Creating random projects
- Never finishing any of them
- Procrastination!
- (don't wanna forget that last one!)

I'm also working on (Sometimes):
- Private Project (for now)

I had worked on these (but dropped them):
- [Bound](https://www.sayo.dev/projects/Bound/)
- [Deimos](https://www.sayo.dev/projects/Deimos/)

I've also finished these projects:
- [Potatech website](https://sayo.dev/commissions/potatech)


I don't really have much else here :D
Have a wonderful day! yeyeye!
